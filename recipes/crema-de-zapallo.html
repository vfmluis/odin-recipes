    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 ripe squashes (butternut squash or orange pumpkin), approximately 1.4 kg</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes, approximately 450 g</li>
        <li>1 red onion, approximately 80 g</li>
        <li>4 cups broth, approximately 1 L</li>
        <li>1 chicken broth cube</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>½ cup light cream, approximately 120 ml</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: ½ cup cream, ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, peeled pumpkin seeds, and hot pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the squashes very well, and dry them. Then peel them with a sharp knife. Cut them in half, and scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Cut into cubes of approximately two centimeters.</li>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes. Then cut them into cubes of three centimeters. Place them in a bowl of water to prevent them from turning black.</li>
        <li>Lastly, peel the onions. Chop them into thin strips. Peel the garlic, and cut into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Select a medium-sized pot and place it over a high heat. Immediately add the butter, onions, and garlic. Cook for about three minutes. Stir with a spatula from time to time to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking; drain the potato cubes and add to the pot. Cook for about three more minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the cubed squash. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Pour all the broth into the pot. Add the crumbled concentrated bouillon cube, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook over a high heat for approximately fifteen minutes, until the potatoes and pumpkins are cooked. Turn off the stove. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool down for about ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, pour the contents of the pot and the single cream into the electric blender jar. Blend for at least three minutes, until you get a creamy consistency. If your blender is small, you might have to blend the contents in two or three batches.</li>
        <li>Serve the soup in large bowls, adding a little cream to each serving. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese, pumpkin seeds, and hot chili flakes, if you wish.</li>
